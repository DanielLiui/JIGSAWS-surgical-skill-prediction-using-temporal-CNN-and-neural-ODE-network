Co-author: Jason Au

Code for training a temporal convolution network and neural ODE network model on the JIGSAW surgical dataset to predict the skill levels of surgeons using the DaVinci surgical system. The model is trained on the tooltips kinematics data and predicts suturing, knot-tying, and needle passing skill levels with accuracies of 97%, 100%, and 80% respectively. Skill levels are either expert or non-expert.

Model is also available to download.
