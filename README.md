# Surgical-skill-prediction-using-temporal-CNN-and-neural-ODE-network
Temporal convolution network and neural ODE network model on the JIGSAW surgical dataset to assess the skill levels of surgeons using the DaVinci surgical system. The model predicts suturing, knot-tying, and needle passing skill levels with accuracies of 97%, 100%, and 80% respectively.
