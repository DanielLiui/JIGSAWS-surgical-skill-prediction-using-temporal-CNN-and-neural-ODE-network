# Surgical-skill-prediction-using-temporal-CNN-and-neural-ODE-network
Co-author: Jason Au

The purpose of this study was to explore the ability of neural Ordinary Differential Equations (neural ODEs) to model the changing dynamics of data. A temporal convolution neural network (TCN) with a neural ODE block was implemented to predict the skill level (expert vs non-expert) of surgeons given the time-series kinematics of their tooltip poses using the Da Vinci Robotic system from the JIGSAW dataset. The model achieved 100% test accuracy on the knot tying data, 97% on the suturing data, and 80% on the needle-passing data. 

Model is available in this repository.
